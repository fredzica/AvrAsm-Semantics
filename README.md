This is an implementation of the semantics of Atmel's Avr Assembly language for 8-bits microcontrollers. Its semantics are being written down in the K Framework, a framework meant exactly for executable semantics definition of a programming language.

Much of the microcontrollers' behaviour is being defined too, as it's necessary to have it in order to have an ambient for the assembly language to execute.

This is an work in progress started not long ago. Because of this not many features of the language are defined yet.

---- Currently working on release v3.4 of K Framework ----
