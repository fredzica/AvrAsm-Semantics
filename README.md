This is an implementation of the semantics of Atmel's Avr Assembly language for 8-bits microcontrollers. Its semantics are being written down in the K Framework, a framework meant exactly for executable semantics definition of a programming language.

Much of the microcontrollers' behaviour is being defined too, as it's necessary to have it in order to have an ambient for the assembly language to execute.

This is an work in progress.

---- Currently working on release nightly release from 14 January. Trying to cope with the use of the Java backend of K ----
